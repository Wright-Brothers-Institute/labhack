    <p>The Swarm and Search AI Competition Series is excited to announce the 2021 Challenge: Capture the Flag. This collaborative challenge formulated by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in the United States and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (dstl) in the UK, will bring together competitive AI experts from around the world. Can your skills capture the flag and conquer the competition?</p>
    <p>Partners like AFRL and dstl must deliver operational capability to our Air, Space and Cyber Warfighters who share a culture of urgency to outpace future threats, and this event aims to attract the best and brightest minds to solve autonomy, AI challenges and spark innovation. This Capture the Flag Challenge can have significant impact for search and rescue operations executed by military and first responder communities, reducing risks to save lives.</p>
    <p>Teams that demonstrate innovative solutions will enjoy international acclaim. AFRL and dstl employ and partner with some of the worldâ€™s leading tech developers. This challenge provides an opportunity to introduce participants to potential career opportunities. Additionally, innovative solutions will be featured at highly regarded Air Force events, such as the Air Force Association Virtual Air, Space & Cyber Conference, which attracts more than 10,000 registrants, 85 exhibitors and sponsors, 94 distinguished speakers, and 30 panels and presentations.</p>
