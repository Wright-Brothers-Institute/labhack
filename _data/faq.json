		"question": "Who can participate in this competition?",
		"answer": "The SSAI-Capture the Flag is open to any individual or group. There is no limit on the size of the group but each group must have a single leader that is a resident of the US or UK that is the official entry point for the group and is responsible for the groups participation."

		"question": "Why do we need to declare what “League” we are in?",
		"answer": "The SSAI-Capture the Flag competition is set up so that the top teams in each league (US Vrs UK) will participate in a showdown in early Summer 2021.  The top 16 teams in each league will face a single elimination playoff to define a “League” winner.   This showdown will occur hopefully in joint sessions held in the US and UK at a live-virtual event to be scheduled.
