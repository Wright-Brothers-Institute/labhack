My name is David Wirth and for the past 7 years I have been experimenting and discovering new and improved ways to scare my friends, family and neighbors with the wonders of science! Through the years I have created railguns, coilguns, high power LEDs, high voltage devices, freeze guns, high pressure squirt guns, cryogenic coolers, rocket engines, and much more. My thesis at UCLA was on the experimental study of photoreactive nanoparticles which heat up when exposed to light. This property was leveraged in order to create a novel re-startable solid rocket engine which was published with my MS thesis in 2012. Since then, I have worked with AFRL, the Discovery Channel, the USAF, and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), lending my skills in to those in need.
