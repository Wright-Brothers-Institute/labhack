Wild cards will be added to fill out the conference winners from the 2nd place winners in the conferences to make a full 10 conferences. (i.e. if we have 70 teams there will be 7 wild cards and the 2nd place teams are in)</p>
    
    <p></p>
    
    <p><u>Between 101 and 1000 teams</u></p>

    <p style= "color:#FF0000";>Friday 20	Aug 2021 Showcase event</p>
    <p>The showcase event will be a single-elimination tournament. There will be two brackets (one from the US and one from the UK), with seeds determined by the results from 19 July. Spectators can watch games in breakout rooms, in between talks given by AI Experts. The final game will be between the winner of the US bracket and the winner of the UK bracket.</p>
    
    <p></p>
    
    <p>Because of the random generation of each game's environment, it is not guaranteed that the first seeds will win their brackets.</p>
