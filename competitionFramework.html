    <p></p>
    
    <p>Depending on number of submissions we will determine the rankings as follows:</p>

    <p><u>20 or less teams:</u></p>
    <p>Full round robin where all teams will play each other team to create the rankings. Top 8 rankings will be invited to the Showcase.</p>
    
    <p><u>100 or less teams:</u></p>
    <p>10 conferences will be held, and a full round robin will be completed in each conference. The conference winners will be then competed against the other conference winners in a full round robin to determine the final ranking. Top 8 rankings will be invited to the Showcase. Wild cards will be added to fill out the conference winners from the 2nd place winners in the conferences to make a full 10 conferences. (i.e. if we have 70 teams there will be 7 wild cards and the 2nd place teams are in).</p>
    
    <p><u>1000 or less teams:</u></p>
    <p>10 sub conferences will be held, and a full round robin will be completed in each sub conference. The subconference winners will be then competed against the other sub conference winners. Wild cards will be added to fill out the sub conference winners from the 2nd place winners to make a full 10 conferences. A full round robin will be completed in each of these 10 conferences. All the conference winners will be competed in a full round robin against each other to determine the final ranking. Top 8 rankings will be invited to the Showcase.</p>
    
    <p style= "color:#FF0000";>19	Aug 2021 Announcement of the showcase finalist and team rankings</p>

    <p style= "color:#FF0000";>20	Aug 2021 Showcase event</p>
    <p>This will be a single elimination “tournament” with the top seeded teams from each league playing to advance in their bracket. These will be revealed to the audience in the four steps 8-4-2-1 in each league. During this time people can watch the plays in breakout rooms during talks during the day. The bracket will be shown to the main stage after each session. The final play will be the US winner vs. the UK winner.</p>
    <p>We picked this single elimination only for the showcase to heighten the drama and due to the random placement of the buildings it is not guaranteed that the number 1 seed will win. However we will know the rankings, so this will make sure the best teams are playing each other.</p>
