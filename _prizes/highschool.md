We also have a special prize category for High School teams that would like to participate. These teams will be given the challenge 2 weeks in advance to their school sponsors. They will be able to present at the Sunday overall presentations but will only compete with the other high school teams. A $500 prize will be given to the best High School team submission from each location.
