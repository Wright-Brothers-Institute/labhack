The LabHack competition has some basic rules that all participants need to follow.


- <span class="rule-short">Fresh Code:</span> We all start coding at the same time. This is done to keep things fair. Please don’t come in and build on top of previous projects if you want to win. It’s cool to work on designs beforehand, digital mockups, open source frameworks, and anything else available to everyone, but try to keep things within just limits.

- <span class="rule-short">Code Review:</span> Winning teams will be subject to a code-review at some point following the event or immediately before winning.

- <span class="rule-short">Ownership and IP:</span> For the sake of simplicity, all team projects judged in the event will be open source with a permissive license. Submissions must use one of the following licenses

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license" target="_blank">mit</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">creative commons zero</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0)" target="_blank">apache 2.0</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-3-clause" target="_blank">bsd 3-clause "new" or "revised"</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-2-clause" target="_blank">bsd 2-clause "simplified" or "freebsd" license</a></li>
	<li>any of the gnu licenses</li>
</ul>

- <span class="rule-short">Team Size:</span> Teams of two to five humans are allowed. You can also add 1 cyborg, Furby, drone, or Sphero. Part of the intent of this competition is to meet and work with new people. For this reason, __single person teams are not allowed for this competition__

- <span class="rule-short">Remote Participants:</span> Teams may have remote participants. However, At least 49% of team members must be physically present during demos and judging.

- <span class="rule-short">Submissions:</span> Projects should be submitted on our hackathon.io page. Submission time is 2pm Sunday.

- <span class="rule-short">DEMO your Hack:</span> You must demo your hack in order to present. No slide-decks or power-points will be allowed. Don’t be scared if you didn’t finish… it’s okay long as you tried your best.

- <span class="rule-short">Have fun:</span> It’s a hackathon! Use whatever languages or hacks you have in your arsenal. Show us hardware. Show us new concepts. Show us anything you’d like.
